# Groopet: Groomer Appointment Scheduling App
 
# Introduction
 Pet groomers enjoy spending time with animals and giving them the attention they need to have healthy coats, nails, and happy owners. This project intends to facilitate interactions between pet groomers and pet owners so that they can conduct business in a secure and simple manner. The pet groomers will be able to register their accounts so that clients can schedule them thanks to the technology that will be built. The registered groomers' information can be viewed by the clients, who can also post reviews for the groomers. This will aid clients in selecting the most appropriate pet groomer. They can also choose the groomers' visitation schedule. The user's internet connection will also affect the development of the program; if the user's data connection is slow, so will be the procedure for gathering data from the application server. The use of this software will significantly improve the pet grooming experience for both pet owners and pet stylists.
