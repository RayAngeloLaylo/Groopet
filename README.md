<h1 align = "center" > Groopet: Groomer Appointment Scheduling App. </h1>
 
### Introduction

<p align = "justify"> Pet groomers enjoy spending time with animals and giving them the attention they need to have healthy coats, nails, and happy owners. The big aspect of appropriate pet care is grooming. Pet grooming prevents odors from entering the home and reduces dandruff and shedding. Curls and loose hair can be removed through pet grooming. By using grooming products on a regular basis, you can actually lower the likelihood that your pet will remain unwashed. Taking care of a pet is a major commitment. Owners of dogs and cats should take care to properly groom their animals and socialize them.
  
  Regular pet grooming has several advantages, but one of the most significant is that it promotes positive behavior. Regular grooming will have a favorable impact on your pet's mental health. Being around a cute, well-groomed pet is enjoyable. People's encouragement of your pet will have a positive impact on his or her mental health, which will enhance behavior.

  Additionally, the team plans to design and create a mobile application that will give users access to data about registered groomers, assisting clients in selecting the groomer who is most appropriate for their pets. </p>

### Purpose and Description
<p align = "justify">Groopet intends to facilitate communication between pet groomers and pet owners in order to provide a simple and secure transaction. The pet groomers will be able to register their accounts on the newly designed technological method so that clients may make appointments with them. The registered groomers' information is available to the clients, who can also rate the groomers. This will assist clients in selecting the best pet groomer. They can choose the frequency of the groomers' visits as well. The user's internet connection will also affect the development of the program; if the user's data connection is slow, so will be the procedure for gathering data from the application server.</p>

### Objective

<p align = "justify"> The main goal of this study is to create Groopet, a platform and mobile application to assist pet owners and pet groomers in having a positive experience when it comes to grooming their pets and to have a secure and simple transaction. Groopet will be developed using the technology HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the use of the Ionic and Angular Frameworks.</p>

### Significance of the Project

Community - The community benefits from this application by making pet grooming more enjoyable. They can look up the details of the registered groomers to determine which one is ideal for their pets. 

Pet Owners - One of your most important responsibilities is to keep an eye on your pet's health. This includes having a balanced diet, exercising frequently, and maintaining proper grooming. Even though many pet owners might think that paying for pet grooming is a waste of money, your pet will benefit greatly from it. One of the key benefits of pet grooming is that owners frequently fail to notice subtle changes that occur to their pets over time. When you see your pet every day, it can be easy to miss little weight changes or invisible skin issues, for example.
